This is a little project I've started working on. This is basically a simple text editor that allows users to create and
save notes into a sqlite database. 

Current functionality
- Allows you to name a note and add contents to a note. 
- The "save note" button saves the note to a sqlite database. 
- Set a way to recall the 7 most recent notes that were saved.
- Set a way to edit these notes. 
- Created a way to clear the text boxes to create a new note. 

Currently, working on:
- Modify the way that notes are recalled so that more than most recent notes can be recalled.

Next steps
- Deleting notes.
- Adding structure to database to organize notes into "projects" or something similar to that.
