This is a little project I've started working on.

Current functionality
- Allows you to name a note and add contents to a note. 
- The "save note" button saves the note to a sqlite database. 
- Set a way to recall the 7 most recent notes that were saved.
- Set a way to edit these notes. 
- Created a way to clear the text boxes to create a new note. 

Next steps
